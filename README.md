# Encrypty: A Parallel File Encryption Utility

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C%2B%2B-blue.svg)

Encrypty is a C++ command-line utility designed to encrypt and decrypt files within a directory. This project serves as a practical demonstration of various concurrency models in C++, showcasing sequential, multi-process, and multi-threaded approaches to file processing. It also implements different encryption algorithms to illustrate a range of security levels.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multiple Concurrency Models:** Implements file processing sequentially, with multiple processes, and with multiple threads.
* **Variety of Encryption Algorithms:** Demonstrates both a classical Caesar cipher and the industry-standard **AES-256-GCM** for robust security.
* **Directory Traversal:** Recursively finds and processes all files within a specified directory.
* **Environment-Based Configuration:** Securely manages encryption keys and passwords using a `.env` file.

## üåø Branch Overview

This repository is structured into three main branches, each demonstrating a unique approach to the problem.

### üå≥ `main` branch
* **Concurrency Model:** Sequential Processing
* **Description:** This branch processes files one by one. It uses a standard `std::queue` to line up file tasks and executes them in a single-threaded, synchronous manner. It serves as a baseline for performance comparison.
* **Encryption Algorithm:** Basic Caesar Cipher.

### üöÄ `multiprocessing` branch
* **Concurrency Model:** Multi-Processing
* **Description:** This branch leverages the power of multiple CPU cores by creating a separate child process for each file using the POSIX `fork()` system call. Inter-process communication and task queuing are managed using POSIX shared memory (`shm_open`, `mmap`) and named semaphores.
* **Encryption Algorithm:** Basic Caesar Cipher.

### ‚ö° `multithreading` branch
* **Concurrency Model:** Multi-Threading
* **Description:** This branch uses a pool of worker threads (`std::thread`) to process files in parallel. It implements a thread-safe producer-consumer queue using `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` for efficient task distribution.
* **Encryption Algorithm:** **AES-256-GCM** (via OpenSSL), a modern authenticated encryption cipher providing high security and data integrity.

## üöÄ Build and Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Checkout your desired branch:**
    ```bash
    # Example:
    git checkout multithreading
    ```

3.  **Configure the Environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    * For the `main` and `multiprocessing` branches, add a numeric key:
        ```
        CRYPTION_KEY=3
        ```
    * For the `multithreading` branch, add a secure password:
        ```
        CRYPTION_PASSWORD="your-strong-and-secret-password"
        ```

4.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This will create two executables: `encrypt_decrypt` and `cryption`.

5.  **Run the application:**
    The main application processes an entire directory.
    ```bash
    ./encrypt_decrypt
    ```
    The program will then prompt you to enter a directory path and an action (`encrypt` or `decrypt`).

    **Example:**
    ```
    Enter the directory path: test
    Enter the action (encrypt/decrypt): encrypt
    ```
